Just a small post to leave myself a memory. ðŸ™‚

[python-durationpy](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:kubic/python-durationpy) is the very first rpm package, I packaged all from scratch for the first time in OBS.

This was needed to bump the [python-kubernetes](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:kubic/python-kubernetes) version to `31.0.0` (a newly added python dependency).
