I had the opportunity to co-chair the first ever CNCF Maintainer Summit, which was also the first one held in India.  
The event took place on **December 10, 2024**, as part of the KubeCon + CloudNativeCon India 2024 (the first ever KubeCon in India), at Yashobhoomi (India International Convention & Expo Centre). 
(so many *first evers*, I know ðŸ˜‚)
