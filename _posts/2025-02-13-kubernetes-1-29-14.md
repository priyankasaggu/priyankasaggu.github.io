The Kubernetes v1.29.0, aka the [Kubernetes Mandala](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/12/13/kubernetes-v1-29-release/) was released on _**December 13, 2023**_. This marked the last (major) Kubernetes minor version release of the year, 2023.  
_(The original release date was December 5, 2023, but then we had a few rounds of un-avoidable delays.)_ ðŸ™‚

This is a very special release for me. I had the honor of being the Release Lead for Kubernetes v1.29 Release cycle, which had a team of [40 ever amazing folks](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.29/release-team.md).  
This release, like all others, also had a very special theme & logo â€” thanks to _**Jason Braganza**_. He shared the story â€“ [On How the Kubernetes v1.29 Logo Came About](https://janusworx.com/work/on-how-the-kubernetes-v129-logo-came-about/).

Iâ€™m really grateful for my experience during the 4 months from September to December 2023. It had its ups and downs, but I learned a *lot* lot.  
Most importantly, it helped me become more confident and comfortable in having conversations, discussions, and especially, in _finding solutions_ â€“ both on regular days and especially on tough ones.
