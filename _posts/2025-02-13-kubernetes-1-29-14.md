The Kubernetes v1.29.0, aka the [Kubernetes Mandala](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/12/13/kubernetes-v1-29-release/) was released on December 13, 2023. 
This marked the last (major) Kubernetes minor version release of the year 2023.
_(it was released after its many rounds of delay, the original release date was December 5, 2023)_

And it's a very special release for me.
I had the honor to be the Release Lead for Kubernetes v1.29 Release cycle, which had a team of the [40 ever amazing folk](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.29/release-team.md), and also [a very beautiful & special theme & logo](https://janusworx.com/work/on-how-the-kubernetes-v129-logo-came-about/).

Today, February 13, 2025, after an year and 2 months later, marks the final release of Kubernetes 1.29 aka, the v1.29.14.

I’m really grateful for the 4 months from September to December 2023.
It had its ups and downs, but I learned a *lot* lot.
Most importantly, it helped me become more confident and comfortable in having conversations, discussions, and _finding solutions_ – both on regular days and especially on tough ones.
