[Kubernetes v1.29.0 (Mandala)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/12/13/kubernetes-v1-29-release/) was finally released on December 13, 2023, after its few rounds of delays.

It's a special release for me – I was the Release Lead for Kubernetes v1.29.0, which was a team of the [ever amazing 40 people](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.29/release-team.md), and also [a very beautiful logo](https://janusworx.com/work/on-how-the-kubernetes-v129-logo-came-about/).

Now after, exactly an year and 2 months later, today marks the final release of Kubernetes 1.29 aka, the v1.29.14.
